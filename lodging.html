          September is a busy time in NYC/Brooklyn, so getting reservations sooner rather
          than later can help. It is not expected that everyone will stay in the same place,
          but we did want to give some assistance that might help for those that may not
          be as familiar with the city.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-5"><h1 class="text-center">Sheraton Hotel Brooklyn Wedding Room Block</h1>
          We have a courtesy hold for a block of rooms for the “Bates/Bolivar Wedding”
          at the Sheraton (Marriott) located at 228 Duffield Street. It is located in
          Downtown Brooklyn and is one of the closest hotels to where the wedding and
          reception will take place. It is also close to several Metro stops.
          <p class="font-weight-bold">Reservations for one of the blocked rooms must be received before the
            cut-off date of 7/30/2024.</p> <h2 class="text-center">Below is a link to reserve one of the blocked
              rooms: </h2></p>

          <p class="text-center"> <br>
   
          There are only a limited number of rooms that could be held, so if you are
          interested, you may want to follow-up ASAP. Once the number of rooms are
          taken and/or the deadline passes, the link won’t be available.</p>


          <p class="mt-5"><h1 class="text-center">Other Accommodation Options</h1></p>


         <p class="text-center"> There are many other accommodation options including others in the
          Brooklyn area and others just over the bridge in Manhattan - some with major
          chains such as other Marriotts, Hilton properties, etc. and independent places,
          such as VRBO/AirBnBs.Below are just a few hotel options that are in the area.</p>

            We live in Brooklyn which is just across the East River from Manhattan - you can
            walk, bike, or take the subway easily between Brooklyn and Manhattan.</p>
  
            <p class="text-center mt-5">The wedding and reception will take place in the DUMBO (Down Under the
              Manhattan Bridge Overpass) section of Brooklyn. It is a distinct area of
              Brooklyn near the East River between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. 
              Since people may be staying in Brooklyn and might not be as familiar with the
              Downtown Brooklyn and DUMBO areas, we wanted to give you some recommendations for our favorite places in our neck of the "woods".</p>

            <div class="" id="frontpage-content">
            <hr class="border-2 border-dotted m-3">


            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCUomfnHebzFQHWD8" target="_blank">Fort Greene Park (Fort Greene, Brooklyn)</a></h2><p class="m-2"> Located in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn (adjacent to downtown) this park is as equally great for people(and dog!) watching as it is for seeking a lush green refuge from the hustle and bustle. A quintessential city park. Plus, there are tons of excellent food options all along the perimeter of the park (see next reccomendation!).</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QciFGxTSqAWc189M6" target="_blank">Seraghina (Fort Greene, Brooklyn)</a></h2><p> Live your best Italian life right here in Brooklyn by heading to Seraghina for a proper Milanese cafe style lunch or brunch! Want to do it Vero style?  Opt for their Negroni with a black truffle pizza to boot. (get it, boot..Italy)</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vdfGtba8KTNhx5sT8" target="_blank">Dekalb Market (Downtown Brooklyn)</a></h2><p> Hungry? This underground food hall houses over 40 food vendors, including old-school & new-school NYC names. Why head to Manhattan when you can get a famous Katz pastrami sandwich right here at their stall.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/J7qLHDRtDnGcDWXs6" target="_blank">Threes Brewery (Gowanus, Brooklyn)</a> </h2><p> Want to really live like a local? Head to threes brewing in Gowanus. Think of it as a big local backyard hang complete with delicious beer, great food and sometimes even live music! </p>

            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/toJT4P7DdNFn8KoH7" target="_blank">Pollo D'Oro (Downtown Brooklyn)</a></h2><p> We discovered this in June when our parents came to help us prepare for the wedding. What was initially a shot in the dark dinner plan ended up becoming a hit and now one of our favorite spots! Try their delicious ceviche or famous rotisserie chicken. Both pair exquisitely with a signature peruvian pisco sour cocktail.</p> 

            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1xksFkAsjLjAa1c3A" target="_blank">White Maize (Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn)</a> </h2><p> This is a favorite lunch or dinner spot, that is local in our Carroll Gardens neighborhood and brings a taste of Venezuela. If you're in the mood for an arepa or cachapa, this is the place. Good for a quick bite to eat.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center mt-5"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6QbjvW1ZYaTqoGAr5" target="_blank">Mala Project (East Village, Manhattan)</a></h2><p> More than a meal, this is a szechuan hotpot experience. Get your taste buds ready to explore the unique flavors and ingredients offered on their menu. Nice atmosphere and delicious cocktails too. There are locations in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. (TIP: We typically opt for the Manhattan location as it is actually closer to us!
            )</p>
